# Centrale â€“ Engineering School Labs (DATASIM Option)

This repository contains some of the lab works (TPs) I worked on during my second year in the engineering school Centrale Nantes, within the **DATASIM** option.

The **DATASIM** program focuses on the design of digital and algorithmic solutions for data analysis and signal processing. It covers topics such as:
- Statistical modeling
- Data representation
- Signal and image processing
- Optimization
- Machine learning and deep learning
- Applied computer science
- Scientific computing

Some of the notebooks may be unfinished. The main goal is to share what I studied and the kinds of problems I worked on.
